      <h3>Ali Ay</h3>
      <p>I am a student at City, University. Before I started this course I alreday had some Java and html experience as I take personal lessons in my spare time. In college I learnt machine programming which I used to make a robotic arm and programmed it to move. I also made an electric go-Kart with a team of three other students which took us 4 months. When im not programming I really enjoy spending time with my friends and new learning skills such as music production as music helps me concentrate. </p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Moving Stars</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City (2020). This Processing project demonstrates a comprehensive understanding 
	of the use of randomness and the basics of processing. I created a 2D image of stars which move left and right however I adjusted the size of the stars so that they grow larger when moving towards the end of the sketch therefore giving it more of a 3D effect. To get this project to work I used varibles, methods, loops, arrays and commands such as import to add music to my project. Overall this was a fun learning experience and im looking forward to future projects.

    <h3>Finns Day Out</h3>
    <p>
     I really enjoyed this project and was really excited when it was announced that we had to make a game for our coursework. When I first started to make my game I had to spend one week coming up with ideas, names and drawing out the diffrent levels that I would build. Next I just started to complete the milestones one by one which helped me organise my objectives in the game. Fins Day Out is a platform game where Finn needs to make his way up to the top of the screen by dodging enemies and collecting coins and other objects such as Jake the dog which will allow him to progress to the next level. Playing the game is very simple you need to use the arrow keys to move the player left and right then you could use the space key to make the player jump up. The game also has buttons on the screen which allow you to save, load, pause, resume and quit the game. A few challenges I faced when making this game was getting my game to reset when the main player collides with the enemy. Another challenge was making the sounds as I made all the background music myself using my music production skills. I also recorded the Jake and princess sound myself this was challenging for me as I needed to find the correct sounds which fit the charcters and a quiet space to record them in. I really enjoyed making this project and im looking forward to make more like this.
        
        (I didn't have time to play the game properly as it takes around 4 minutes so I had to use the jbugger view to go through the levels in two minutes. I also did not talk as I wanted all my games music and sounds to be heard properly.
